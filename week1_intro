INTRODUCTION/BUSINESS PROBLEM

The severity of the car accident can be estimated using the weather conditions, road conditions and visibility options. This is to lower the chances of accident ration 
and predict the collision rate. This will eventually reduce the risk or count of car accidents by developing an algorithm based on above criteria. When the above stated
conditions are BAD the project can predict and eventually alert the driver for lowering the risk of accident.
